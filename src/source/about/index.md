Software Engineer with proven experience in leading high performance teams


## First contact with Programming…
In 2003, at age 13, when HPG and KIT.NET still existed, and allowed users with no programming knowledge to create their personal pages. This sparked my interest in going deeper and studying about HTML and JAVASCRIPT. This curiosity ended up leading me to PHP, which is officially the first programming language I had contact with.

## Experiences with Development…
Since then, a long journey began, and my passion for developing applications took over and I ventured into other languages, a passage without major highlights, with personal studies, freelance work, and even some attempts at startups that did not go ahead, however it yielded a good experience and awakened my entrepreneurial side. In 2013 I got to know ASP.NET FRAMEWORK with C# and the set of tools that Microsoft provides to developers, and it became the flagship in my daily life with development. From then on, I had contact in personal and professional projects in Web Forms, Windows Forms and MVC. In June 2014 I started the startup Zanco Automação Comercial, an application for automation and management of small and medium-sized wholesale and retail companies. In April 2016, through the IBM Hackathon in partnership with GS1, I participated in the creation of the then TemPraJá project, today a startup, which aims to avoid the waste of perishable products through a multiplatform system of commerce and donation,

## What I currently do…
I currently lead development teams at XP Inc, being responsible for managing the teams that evolve and support the AMS (Asset Management Service) digital platforms.
