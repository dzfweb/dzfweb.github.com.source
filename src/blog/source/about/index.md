## Who am I?

I am a versatile engineer who can tackle any challenge and deliver value to the company. I am always eager to learn new skills and adapt to different environments.

I have a solid background in Software Engineering & Management, with a proven track record of working in the capital markets industry. I have expertise in various aspects of the development lifecycle, such as coding, support, and technology management in complex environments. I also have experience in managing technology budgets and projects.

I have worked with a wide range of technologies, including Microsoft Technologies (C#, .NET, Azure), Node.JS, typescript and React. I am proficient in these technologies and always ready to explore new ones.

## First contact with Programming…

I have always been fascinated by the power of the web and how it can connect people and ideas. My journey as a web developer began in 2003, when I was 13 years old and discovered HPG and KIT.NET, two brazilian platforms that enabled anyone to create their own websites without any coding skills. I was amazed by the possibilities and wanted to learn more about how websites were built. I started to explore HTML and JAVASCRIPT, the languages that define the structure and behavior of web pages.

I was hooked by the creativity and logic involved in coding. I soon moved on to PHP, which is the first programming language I ever learned. PHP allowed me to create dynamic and interactive web applications that could communicate with databases and users. I was thrilled by the challenges and rewards of solving problems and creating solutions with code.

## Experiences with Development…

I always loved developing applications and exploring different languages. My journey started with php as I mentioned in the previous section, but I soon expanded my horizons to other technologies. Along the way, I learned a lot from personal studies, freelance work, and startup projects. Some of them did not work out, but they gave me valuable experience and ignited my entrepreneurial spirit.

In 2013, I discovered ASP.NET with C# and the amazing tools that Microsoft offers to developers. It became my favorite platform for creating applications for a while. I used Web Forms, Windows Forms and MVC for various personal and professional projects.

In June 2014, I founded Zanco Automação Comercial, an application for automation and management of small and medium-sized wholesale and retail companies.

In April 2016, I participated in the IBM Hackathon in partnership with GS1, where we created the TemPraJá project, now a startup, which aims to prevent the waste of perishable products through a multiplatform system of commerce and donation.

I have a long and successful career at XP Inc starting in 2017, where I learned valuable skills for high volume and low latency scenarios. I have expertise in API monitoring, cloud computing, security, OWASP and other crutial knowledges for financial sector, including legal and compliance responsabilities.

I keep enjoing creating, maintaining and developing software and solutions for various projects and challenges, now with teams abroad.
